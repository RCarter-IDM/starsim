    "## Mesa: Wealth model\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Starsim is intended primarily for modeling disease, it can also be used as a general-purpose agent-based model.  This example illustrates a simple \"weath model\", in which each agent starts with a single unit of wealth, and on each timestep, every agent with more than zero wealth gives one unit of wealth to another agent.\n",

    "This tutorial is adapted from the following example:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Setting up the model\n",
    "\n",
    "We could define the wealth model as any type of module, since they all can store states and update them. Here we will define wealth as a subclass of `ss.Intervention` (though it could equally well be a subclass of `ss.Demographics` or even `ss.Disease`, if you are so inclined). All we need to do is update the `wealth` state (which we can store inside the \"intervention\"), and we can also use this class to track the wealth distribution over time and plot it. The full model looks like this:"
