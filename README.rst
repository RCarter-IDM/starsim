Starsim
=======

**Warning! Starsim is still in the early stages of development. It is being shared solely for transparency and to facilitate collaborative development. It is not ready to be used for real research or policy questions.**

Starsim is an agent-based disease modeling framework in which users can design and configure simulations of pathogens that progress over time within each agent and pass from one agent to the next along dynamic transmission networks. The framework explicitly supports co-transmission of multiple pathogens, allowing users to concurrently simulate several diseases while capturing behavioral and biological interactions. Non-communicable diseases can easily be included as well, either as a co-factor for transmissible pathogens or as an independent exploration. Detailed modeling of mother-child relationships can be simulated from the timepoint of conception, enabling study of congenital diseases and associated birth outcomes. Finally, Starsim facilitates the comparison of one or more intervention scenarios to a baseline scenario in evaluating the impact of various products like vaccines, therapeutics, and novel diagnostics delivered via flexible routes including mass campaigns, screen and treat, and targeted outreach.

The framework is appropriate for simulating one or more sexually transmitted infections (including syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HPV, and HIV), respiratory infections (like RSV and tuberculosis), and other diseases and underlying determinants (such as Ebola, diabetes, and malnutrition).


Background
------------

Starsim leveraged advances made in Covasim, HPVsim, FPsim, and SynthPops to enable the modeling of additional diseases and conditions. 

The goal of Starsim is to enable modeling of multiple diseases, co-infections, and networks, as well as the evolution of population conditions.


Requirements
------------

Python 3.9-3.11 (64-bit). (Note: Python 2.7 and Python 3.12 are not supported, the latter being due to Numba not supporting Python 3.12 at the time of writing.) 

We also recommend, but do not require, installing Starsim in a virtual environment. For more information, see documentation, e.g. Anaconda, Anaconda. Cloud, Google Colab, and GitHub Codespaces.


Installation
------------

Starsim is most easily installed via PyPI: ``pip install starsim``.

Starsim can also be installed locally. To do this, clone first this repository, then run ``pip install -e .`` (don't forget the dot at the end!).


Quick Start Guide
-----------------

If everything is working, the following Python commands will run a simulation with the simplest version of a Starsim model. Weâ€™ll make a version of a classic SIR model::

  import starsim as ss
  
  #Define the parameters
  
  pars = dict(
  	n_agents = 5_000, # Number of agents to simulate
  	networks = dict(  # *Networks* add detail on how agents interact w/ each other
  	type = 'random',  # Here, we use a 'random' network
  	n_contacts = 10   # Each person has an average of 10 contacts w/ other people  
  	),
  
  diseases = dict(    # *Diseases* add detail on what diseases to model
  	type = 'sir',     # Here, we're creating an SIR disease
  	init_prev = 0.1,  # Proportion of the population initially infected
  	beta = 0.5,       # Probability of transmission between contacts
  	)
  )
  
  # Make the sim, run and plot
  sim = ss.Sim(pars)
  sim.run()
  sim.plot()


Usage and documentation
-----------------------

Documentation is available at https://docs.starsim.org. 

Usage examples are available in the ``tests`` folder.

Model structure
---------------

All core model code is located in the ``starsim`` subfolder; standard usage is ``import starsim as ss``. The data subfolder is described below.

The model consists of core classes including Sim, Run, People, State, Network, Connectors, Analyzers, Interventions, Results, and more. These classes contain methods for running, building simple or dynamic networks, generating random numbers, calculating results, plotting, etc.
